# Task Description: Comparative Analysis of Flight Options

The flight data is stored in two XML files, which serve as responses to search queries. These responses contain flight options (under the 'Flights' tag) with comprehensive information for ticket display.

## Web Service Overview

The web service provides endpoints to handle the following requests:
1. **Query:**    - What flight options are available from DXB to BKK?
3. **Analysis:**   - Identify the most expensive, cheapest, fastest, longest, and optimal flight options.
4. **Comparison:**   - Determine the differences between the results of the two queries, including changes in routes and conditions.
